# Setup
Head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/Lilwiggy/training/releases">releases</a> tab and download the latest release.
In that you will find a zip file. Unzip it and in *that* folder there's an exe. You just double click that and you're good to go. You can right click the exe file and hit Send To and select desktop to make a shortcut so you don't need to open the folder each time.
